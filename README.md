### Project Structure Guidelines
- Friend-app
    - src
        - app
            - Shared ```Hosts all shared entities```
                - Components    ```Dumb Components```
                - Containers    ```Smart Components```
                - Directives    ```Shared Directives that add behaviour``` 
                - Guards        ```Logic that prevents behaviour```
                - Pipes         ```Transformers for data rendered```
                - Services      ```Shared Singletons that provide data```
                - Core          ```Shared TypeScript Entities: Classes,enums,interfaces```
            - Feature (example: friend-foe-form)
                - Components    ```Dumb Components```
                - Containers    ```Smart Components```
                - Directives    ```Directives that add behaviour``` 
                - Guards        ```Logic that prevents behaviour```
                - Pipes         ```Transformers for data rendered```
                - Services      ```Singletons that provide data``` 
                - Core          ```Shared TypeScript Entities: Classes,enums,interfaces```
- For now this app only has one feature: Manage friends/foes.
So one version of all these directories will sit in the root/app module.
